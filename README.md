# UMAT_3DFKV-L2-σ
A UMAT file and a 3D example case are provided for the 3D fractional Kelvin-Voigt (FKV) model using the L2-1σ formula.
**The proposed model has been demonstrated to possess superior simulation capabilities compared to the classical integer-order Kelvin-Voigt model. Furthermore, the FKV model discretized using the L2-1σ scheme achieves a convergence order of 3-α, superior to that obtained by the GL formula
